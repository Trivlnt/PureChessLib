# Testing Folder

This folder contains test files and scripts used for testing various functionalities of the Pure Chess Engine. Anything found in this folder is not part of the final production code and is intended solely for testing purposes.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to isolate test-related files and scripts from the main codebase. This separation allows us to experiment, validate, and troubleshoot different aspects of the engine without affecting the stability of the core functionality.

## Guidelines

- **Do Not Commit to Production:** Any files in this folder should not be committed to the main production branch. Keep it separate from the main codebase to avoid accidental inclusion in production releases.

- **Name Descriptively:** When adding test files or scripts, give them descriptive names that reflect the functionality being tested. This makes it easier to identify the purpose of each test.

- **Document Tests:** Include a brief description of each test file or script in this README. Mention the purpose, input, expected output, and any known issues.

## Usage

If you're a developer working on the Pure Chess Engine, you can use this folder to:

- Develop new features in isolation to prevent interfering with the main codebase.
- Test edge cases and complex scenarios to ensure robustness.
- Experiment with potential optimizations and improvements.

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own test files, scripts, or test-related documentation to this folder. If you encounter issues, create a separate branch for your tests, and open pull requests when ready.

## Remember

Although the files here are for testing purposes, it's important to maintain clean and organized code even in the testing phase. This helps ensure that tests accurately reflect real-world usage and potential challenges.

Happy testing!
